# Inspiration
We wanted to create a thrilling VR experience that combines fast-paced combat with an eerie, pirate-themed world. Inspired by classic pirate lore and supernatural legends, Ghosts of the Harbour brings a unique blend of action, adventure, and treasure hunting into an immersive VR setting.

# What it does
Ghosts of the Harbour puts players in the boots of a fearless pirate who must battle explosive ghost pirates and steal their cursed gold. Players use weapons, quick reflexes, and strategic combat mechanics to survive against waves of spectral foes while navigating dynamic shipwrecks and haunted coves.

# How we built it
We developed the game in Unity, leveraging VR-specific mechanics for immersive first-person combat. We used physics-based interactions to make sword fighting and shooting feel realistic, and implemented AI behaviors to create challenging ghost enemies. The environment was designed with high-detail assets, atmospheric lighting, and spatial audio to enhance immersion.

# Challenges we ran into
Fine-tuning the physics for smooth and responsive combat interactions. Balancing difficulty to keep gameplay engaging but not frustrating. Optimizing performance for a seamless VR experience, especially with multiple enemies on screen.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating an intense and immersive combat system that feels fluid in VR. Designing visually stunning environments that enhance the supernatural pirate theme. Developing AI-driven ghost pirates that react dynamically to player actions.

# What we learned
Best practices for optimizing VR performance in Unity. How to design engaging combat mechanics for a first-person VR experience. The importance of balancing gameplay difficulty for different player skill levels.

# What's next for Ghosts of the Harbour
We plan to expand the game with: More enemy types, including ghostly sea creatures and pirate captains. Multiplayer co-op, allowing players to raid ghost ships together. Additional weapons and abilities to give players more combat options. A full campaign mode with a rich storyline and hidden treasures to discover.
